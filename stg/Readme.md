### Toy code example for Selective Tampering Generation (STG)

Due to the ban from the cooperative company, we can only provide the toy STG code instead of its original code.

This toy code is a simplified version (only has 5% lines) of the original STG.

**It cannot be used in generate realistic data as in DocTamper**, since most of the important functions for real-world application, such as OCR, post-processing, filtering and accerlating are deleted.

**However, it can be used to understand the paper, since most of the functions proposed in the paper are retained.**
